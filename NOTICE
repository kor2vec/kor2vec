    Reason why we rebuilt the organization and project repo of kor2vec are followings.


1. Releasing trained model with public non-commercial only corpora
    Most of corpora which released to public are blocked to use as
    commercial usage, and only for research purposes.
    This kind of regulation makes harder to train and release the model
    from public corpus, when corporation control the open-source project.
    Even if it's purpose for research works, it has some legal problem
    in the perspective of company. This is the reason why we made independent organization.

2. Project Managing Issue
    Currently, Naver corporation has to be the admin of previous naver/kor2vec project.
    But the main maintainer (first creator @codertimo) is currently not in Naver.
    It've made some difficulty to add ci, auto-deployment, specific-community rule setting.
